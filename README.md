# POST Failure Diagnostic Tool

Hey, this is my attempt at making a little POST and PC power diagnostic tool.  
It’s rough, it’s not pretty, but I’m working on it.  

The goal is to help walk someone through common PC boot / POST failures (no power, no display, beep codes, debug LEDs, etc.) with a step-by-step decision tree.  
I’ve also started adding a knowledge base so each step can include instructions, tips, or even a video to make it easier for people who aren’t familiar with hardware troubleshooting.
